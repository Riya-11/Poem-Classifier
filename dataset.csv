A still moment,"Take a moment.
Put the worries behind.
Take in the beauty around.
Let it relax your mind.

Watch the golden glow
Of the rising morning sun.
Embrace the peaceful aura
Of the break of dawn.

Savor the soft caress
Of the gently moving breeze.
Listen to its nifty tune
Among the swaying trees.

Enjoy the lovely scene
Of a floating butterfly.
Graceful flight and happy tweets
Of a bird perched up high.

Peruse the evening sky
In its dazzling splendor.
The wide and open pallet
Merging shapes and colors.

Relish the loving sight
Of children having fun,
Skipping feet and carefree voices
Under the setting sun.

Spare a still moment
Every once in a while.
Take in the beauty around.
Take it in with a smile.

",Nature
Wind on the hill,"No one can tell me,
Nobody knows,
Where the wind comes from,
Where the wind goes.

It's flying from somewhere
As fast as it can,
I couldn't keep up with it,
Not if I ran.

But if I stopped holding
The string of my kite,
It would blow with the wind
For a day and a night.

And then when I found it,
Wherever it blew,
I should know that the wind
Had been going there too.

So then I could tell them
Where the wind goes 
But where the wind comes from
Nobody knows.
",Nature
Lessons From Nature,"I watch the waves crash in, breaking on the shore
All their anger dispensed on the oceans floor
I look at the sky so blue, sun shining so bright
Spreading heat and happiness with its blinding light
Long blades of grass swaying in the gentle breeze
Dancing in rhythm with so much ease
Look up at the trees hearing the singing of the birds
Happily chirping singing at ease without words
Sitting here holding my knees to my chest
Watching and hearing nature at its best
I ponder how Nature could get it so right
When we have let Nature's lessons get so out of sight
We hold our anger, let our happiness slip away
Making our survival a struggle each and every day
We have forgotten the little things that mean so much
Like the laughter, the freedom, and someone's loving touch
If only I could make people stop, watch and listen to Natures tale
We could all sit back happily and our world would not be so frail
In each others existence in harmony we could all survive
I'm sure like the sun, wind, tree, and birds our lives we could revive
If only we let nature take its course in each and every one of us each day and night
As I sit and ponder how Nature got it so right and we lost all sight.

",Nature
Colors,"I live in a world of yellow and green,
An abundance of colors rarely seen,

With swirling seas of silver and gold,
And crystal mountain tops never foretold,

Sky of amber and clouds of peach,
I picture myself on a pink satin beach.

So open your eyes and let the colors shine through, 
As the colors were made for me and for you

",Nature
Midnight Wonders,"I was tossing in my bed
in the midnight hour,
struggling to get a wink of sleep,
but my eyes lay on the clock tower.

I looked upon the dark sky;
it was adored with sparkling pearls,
which giggled at me
and put a shine to my curls.

I gazed at the chubby moon,
who was white and glistening like milk.
Gave me a lovely, motherly smile
through her lips as rosy pink.

Suddenly, I spotted a shooting star,
as fast as a bullet train.
Behind it was a trail of glittering dust,
which appeared as a long diamond chain.

The dark sky was a dominating evil queen,
who covered the world with her black cape,
captured the stars and the moon,
so their lovely light could not escape.

All these magnificent objects
made my mind calm.
My eyelids started drooping.
I was grateful for their wonderful charm.

Nature had arrived to aid me
when I was trying to catch sleep.
She, with her caring palms,
lulled me to a slumber, so deep...




",Nature
Inner Peace,"The wind whistles past my ears.
Closing my eyes, I lose all my fears.
The waves crash into the rocks.
Out here there is no time on my clock.

The serenity I feel here just soothes my mind.
A peaceful day so hard to find.
The breeze just calms my soul.
Helps me think about what is my life's goal. 

I then look out over the ocean,
And it feels like my life has lost its commotion. 
The sun sets down over the clouds.
But the orange glow around makes me proud.

As the night draws near.
I feel like where I need to be is here.
The soothing nature this afternoon brings
Just feels like such a beautiful thing. 

I sit and wonder where life will go,
But right now all I want is for time to slow.
To enjoy this moment and feel free,
To clear my mind and find some glee.

It's days like these I truly treasure.
Amazing nights and beautiful weather.
It may not seem like much.
But it's moments like these I want to clutch.

For once I feel like life is bliss.
So many hard days in which my happiness was missed. 
I could get lost listening to the waves.
Listening to the birds and watching how the clouds behave.

I could close my eyes and fade into the night.
The tranquility I feel helps me win the fight.
As the waves keep crashing into the rocks,
I feel the happiness in my heart become unlocked.

The day is drawing to a close.
The peacefulness I feel right now I'll only know.
Right now my mind is finally clear.
It's time to go as the night draws near.

",Nature
The Fires Of Winter,"As I walk on the winding path, 
The brisk air softly blows my hair,
Hitting my rosy cheeks
As silence fills the air.
The trees look like skeletons
Standing tall and covered in snow.
A deer pops out of the brush,
And I stop dead in my tracks
As it sprints across the path.
Its grand antlers and powerful legs are a blur.
Somehow in this barren country of snow,
The deer are the only ones who survive
While everyone else goes south. 
They scavenge, they stay, and they live.
They are the fighters of the winter.
As the deer travels out of my sight,
Tranquility overcomes me.
Silence fills the air again.
The wind softly blows my hair
And hits my rosy cheeks.
As I walk on the winding path,
I take in my surroundings and smile
",Nature
Thunderstorms,"My favourite type of weather
Is a thunderstorm for sure
Because when I'm at home
I feel quite secure.

Also the smell of outdoors
While one is taking place
Is beautiful enough
to put a smile on my face. 

I love to watch the rain 
strike some objects outside,
it is amazing to think
this miracle happens worldwide.

Another thing I love
Is feeling rain hit my skin
Little drops of heaven
Sinking to within.

I adore these storms
As they emerge from the sky
The clouds getting darker 
The wind whooshing by

Thunder and lightning
Rain coming down
Hitting the road 
making a sound

As I stare out my window
and watch the rain fall by
I wonder what could of happened
To make God want to cry.
",Nature
I Long For The Wild,"I long for the wild
To feel the wind upon my skin like a thousand soft kisses, 
it's fingers through my hair like a passionate lover.
I long for the wild
The sweet smell of pine, dirt under my feet,
Quakies, quivering, as their branches dance on the breeze.
I long for the wild
The roar of a river,
the sound of water making love to the shore line.
I long for the wild
To lay upon velvety grass, bathing in the soft glow of moonlight,
gazing up at the stars, to feel small.
I long for the wild
It calls to me like a mother calls her child to come home.
",Nature
Nature's Way,"Is there anything as tranquil
As a brightly glowing jonquil
That stands in sweet serenity,
A part of nature's tapestry?

A flower that never questions why,
The rivers flow and birds will fly,
Content to fill part of the plan,
To beautify the world of man.

If we would only realize
We, too, can help to glorify,
To find within each passing day
A happiness along the way.

A loving hug or cheerful smile
Can help to make a life worthwhile.
If all would lend a helping hand,
We soon would have a world so grand.
",Nature
Nightfall,"Yet another day passes.
Over hills, twilight presses.
Moon already hung up high,
Welcoming nightfall.

Birds flying up to their nests,
Chirping time to rest.
Time for peace and stillness,
Time to restore our minds and bodies.

As all fades into night,
A hollow of absence of light.
Only twinkling lights of stars,
Sparkling in amid.

No drama or anger lingering,
No quarrels or crying interrupting,
Only songs of crickets,
Only dances of star lights.

Oh, what a pleasant time.
If only day were this tame,
It would bring peace.
",Nature
I Love A Lonely Winding Road,"I love a lonely winding road
That takes me where I cannot see
Until each softly rounded hill
Reveals its landscaped mystery.
Where nature's stage creates the plot,
What ever the scene may be.

I love the crocus call in spring,
The first to wake from winter's sleep.
Translucent bits of ivory joy,
So patient under snow banks deep,
'Til they can lift each star like face
And proudly nature's rhythm keep.

I love the fiery autumn hues,
Too harsh to bear in gentle spring
But welcomed by the strident wind
That makes the mighty pine tree sing,
Freeing the crimson leaves that dance
Like bright birds, high on wing.

I love the wonders of this world,
The secrets nature guards so well
From those who have no time to spend,
Who will not lift the ocean's shell
And listen to the murmured tale
That each one has to tell.",Nature
"At The Mountainside
","Fresh breeze and snowcapped peaks,
sky inked with pale blue.
The water at the lake is crystal clear,
the green grass, cows silently chew.
The little girl at the lowest hill
is seen plucking flowers:
red, blue, yellow and purple
all seem to have some kind of power.
The clouds are moving at a snail's pace,
and all seems so quite and peaceful
everything is mesmerizing
that away from it you cannot be pulled.
",Nature
Silhouettes In Sunsets,"The sun sets across the horizon 
The shadows grew 
Mesmerized by the colors 
The yellow and orange hues 

The angler by the lake 
Silhouetted and concealed by his background 
The water glimmers against the light 
Like a new jewel found 

An eagle swoops down 
Trying to catch its meal for the day 
Oblivious to the darkening sky 
Searching for its pray 

As I stared out my window 
I sucked in it's beauty 
Took up my paintbrush 
And started to paint the wonderful scenery 

The used to be empty wall 
Is now filled 
With my silhouette and sunset picture 
Is just for your viewing pleasure 

",Nature
Stars,"The luminosity of their sparkle
Blind with devotion, concealed with adoration.
The innocence of their angelic light,
Shine with the boundless uncertainty 
Of where they are to glisten next.

The purity of their bleached glow 
Fill with the endless possibilities of beauty beyond our belief. 
The simplicity of their navigation
Guide us through anguish we often begin to feel.

The delicacy of their gentle awakening
Enliven our sky with slight promises and the fascination of confusion. 
The aspiration the beam lets off
Shows us the path to our capacious imagination full of desires.

The gleam of their twinkle
Darken with perfection, align 
With daydream, and are matched flawlessly
With the unreality of our everlasting fantasies.",Nature
Wind Howling,"Awoken from my nightmarish dreams,
The sounds of wind howling,
Its fists beating against my windows.

Branches scraping,
Like fingernails against the chilled glass.

Shadows creeping across the room
seeking, searching,
a lost child.

Wind howling still,
Like the ongoing, mournful cry of a wolf, 
baying at the full moon.

On and on cries the wind.
Forever searching for ears to listen,
longing to be heard.",Nature
The Lonely Bird,"In a park whither an elderly man once went
was a bird with a voice so wonderful much money would he have spent
just to hear that melodic bird sing
and listen to its voice, with that majestic ring.

But as the seasons passed, so did the bird's voice, 
and the man stopped going, though not by choice,
for his health was beginning to fade
and the bird began to wither too, but he could get no aid.

With no audience for which to sing,
a sad death was all fate would bring.
So it was that the bird passed away,
of all times that spring in late May.

In the summer that man did return,
but of the bird's death never did he learn.
So he listened to all of the birds that came,
but somehow it just never felt the same.
",Nature
On The Wings Of A Song,"Once in a while, if you are feeling blue,
When troubles seem to keep coming along,
If you will take the time to listen to music
It can lift your spirits on the wings of a song.

You don't have to be in a concert hall,
For nature provides its own symphonies.
There are no discords in the murmuring stream,
Or the wind as it gently hums through the trees.

Who has not heard the frogs' cheerful concert
When the nighttime shadows draw near?
If you will take the time to quietly listen,
The evening serenade of crickets you'll hear.

There's a rhythm to the lapping waves on the shore.
In the sky, every bird has its own melody.
Even the mightiest humpback whale
Sings its love songs down deep in the sea.

It may not change the problems that you have.
There are times when things will go wrong.
Still, it can help bring peace to your soul
When you lift your heart on the wings of a song...
",Nature
"The Sky
","Have you seen the Sunset and Sunrise
And the Horizon that's a prize
How the colors mix and melt
And look as soft as felt
How they float away into black
As you wish them back
And that feeling that makes you sad
How the tears come and just make you mad
But then you see the stars
That are so small they could fit in jars
Now there are so many
You'd buy each one with a penny
How they shine so bright
And don't put up a fight
So you stand watching them twinkle and shine
Then you realize you feel fine
So you sigh
And say goodbye.
",Nature
The Countryside,"Deep into the wood where the Bluebells grow
Next to them the wild garlic will show
An old oak creeks with a century of age
With brand new shoots and the sun they crave
A crystal clear brook where the Sticklebacks nest
Flows into a stream where the bull rushes rest
The Swifts swoop down like dive bombing planes
In a field of mown hay set in country lanes
In the distance a Wood Pigeon coos
And the rest of the birds also voice their views
Beneath this sun filled clear blue sky
Hear the distinctive sound of a Pheasant cry
As dusk sets in with moon rising higher
far away glows a farmers pyre
Soon to come the majestic Bat
Skillfully collecting Moth and Gnat
These are the delights that the countryside brings
Peaceful bliss as the Nightjar sings
",Nature
Once More,"As I walk through the woods,
I see a stump where a tree once stood.

The once mighty oak laying down for a nap,
Still as can be on the forest's lap.

I choose to sit and admire the sight
In plenty of time for the first morning light.

Plants glistening with morning dew,
A robin enjoys his carefully perched view.

Animals begin to scurry all about,
The most beautiful scene, there is no doubt.

'Cause when the April storm took its toll,
The forest's top discovered a hole

Right where the fallen oak rests silently,
Long after winds swirled so violently.

The wind spared this forest, well, all but one
And filled the gap with the morning sun.

For it is that beautiful beam of light,
That pours through the opening so very slight,

That beckons me to this quiet, peaceful place,
All within Mother Nature's grace

To sit and watch the forest floor,
Through the beam each day, once more.
",Nature
Natural Life,"Take a moment to notice
The beauty of the trees.
Sit and take a look
At the dancing leaves.
Note the little child
Laughing, playing with a toy.
Always so full of energy;
Humongous amounts of joy.
Don't crush the insects,
Who are 1/1000ths of your weight.
They may creep up your path,
But don't decide their fate.
Life's not about avoiding storms.
Instead, dance in the rain.
The Earth is so beautiful;
Why must we cause it pain?
Take time off your busy schedule
To glance at the starry night.
Because nature is genius.
So pretty, such a sight!

"Ode To Wyoming
","The sky lay vast, 
Contrasted by the rolling hills.
Tumbleweeds bump against the skyline,
Long grasses dance in the wind,
Contrasted by the rolling hills.
Coyotes strut with untamed confidence.
Long grass dances in the wind.
A lonely antelope has nowhere to hide.
The sun begins it decent unto the horizon.
The twilight does not bring solace.
The night stands in vigil.
The sun rises unbiased.
The game is reset.
",Nature
Silent Sight,"All is silent, all is still
No one around to see the thrill;
Small, small light
A shadow moves
The petals move, start to sing
Wind picks up, nature's music starts
Starting at point base, feeling in the heart
Born to feel, always live the same
Never let the soul ever be tame;
Starting to move, step by step
Slowly at first, but fast at last;
Keeping in tune to the sound of the heart
Finishes, beautiful spin; tidy dancer starts off again;
A silent applause, for no one to hear
A feeling of gratitude from those who are near;
Still no one around, absolutely no sound
But a smile suddenly creeps while around everything sleeps.
The heart always goes what the eye always shows
Never give up that feeling you hold....
",Nature
Our Mother Earth,"As I walk across the earth,
thousands of things I get to see.
Birds fly high, soaring higher,
and on the flowers I hear the buzz of bees.

The sun at the dawn, rises within the hills.
Mountains covered with snow,
shining like the crown of silver. 
And the waves touching the cliffs.
The waterfall flowing down
the green-blue mountains.
Rivers forming a dream delta 
before entering the sea.

And while walking on the beach at night,
I feel the cool and sweet smelling breeze.
The slashing sound still feels like
the sound of love and peace.
The moon over the sea,
shining like a ball of gold.
And in every step my eyes hold wonder.
I bend on my knee
to thank the mother earth,
And is the truth.
it's a great pleasure for me,
to live in this wonderland.

The Way Of Nature,"Oh the trees,
See them cluster,
They give you shade,
That's the way of nature.

They feed you,
At the right time,
They feed you with the right things,
That's the way of nature.

The earth rotates,
Around the sun,
It causes day and night all long,
That's the way of nature.

The stars and moon,
Pop out at night,
And there they glow,
With all the light,
That's the way of nature.

The clouds in the sky,
That look like sheep,
They clash together,
And thunder seeps,
That's the way of nature.

Oh! The animals,
See them play,
With all their might,
They go their way,
That's the way of nature.

The blue ocean,
Spreads so far,
It has no end,
Like a war,
That's the way of nature.

The mountains high,
Could touch the sky,
Of different size and colors,
That's the way of nature.


",Nature
My Wooded World,"As a child, I would sit and ponder
at the wooded areas, for their beauty relaxed me.
The sway of the branches and whistling of the winds,
as if they were calling my name.

Then as I grew older, they were my retreat,
for the woods became my own world,
a world full of imagination, creativity,
resourcefulness, as well as inspiration.

I loved my domain, for no problems were too great.
The woods protected me from everything.
The branches would open as to hold me.
The animals, in their busy ways, stopped to welcome me.

It was this place, my wooded world, that I lived for.
It is that place that beckons me now.
For it was only there, in them woods, I felt truly free,
as free as I would feel when your love would surround me.

"Away It Goes
","A leaf falls slowly to the ground, 
going round, round and round, 
first it was green, now it is brown, 
every leaf is like a tear, 
soft and gentle, 
falling from the tree, 
as if it were crying, 
into the stream, 
taken down the river, 
and away it goes,

A petal sits on the ground, 
red as the rose it fell from, 
each petal is like tissue, 
soft and kind to the touch, 
butterflies once landed on it, 
but now insects crawl over it, 
a summer breeze gently blows, 
the petal is taken up to the clouds, 
away it goes,

A butterfly glides slowly around, 
searching for flowers, 
searching for nectar, 
gliding on the summer breeze, 
down to the river and the tear like leaves, 
then up to the clouds and the tissue like petals, 
then back to the flowers, 
and away it goes

Omnipresent Paradise,"Irregular at every post,
Every ridge and every fold,
The contour of every coast,
There is beauty to behold.

The light from the sun,
The smile on a child's face so bold
While basking in innocent fun,
There is beauty to behold.

For every grain of sand, 
Pine cones define the perfect mold,
Umbrellas shelter the land,
There is beauty to behold.

Bound by a drop to the sea,
Light reflecting ripples of gold,
Cliffs so sheer in their intricacy,
There is beauty to behold.

With each day that goes by,
Octopuses dwell deep in the cold,
Flying fish dive into the sky,
There is beauty to behold.

Paradise is everywhere,
One need not be told,
Free for us all to share,
There is beauty to behold.
",Nature
The Grand Canyon,"She picked up her brush and began to paint
Her pallet of earth sometimes was faint
The depth of scene was beyond reach of eye
Topped now and again by a turquoise sky

The colors of her painting began to run
At first a trickle... the torrent had begun
Upon her painting, eyes would struggle to look away
Her thoughts were of a landscape where hearts would play

Stepping back from the canvas, in her gaze it seems
The painting was beyond her wildest dreams
The sound of water echoed upon the wall
As she hung the painting in the great hall

She unveiled her canvas and offered it to him
Then footprints appeared on the edge of the rim
She knew they would come from the world around
Drawn by a painting... created in the ground

",Nature
Alaska,"I always like winter best.
Windy and rainy,
It appears to never rest.

See the water fall beside
This dark, hidden road,
Far from the calm ocean tide.

This is a beautiful land
Frozen within ice
Where the great trees strongly stand.

Beyond the town of Skagway
Gates to the Klondike
Where peace seems to always stay.

Saw-tooth peaks point to the sky
Tall and majestic
Where nature's great secrets lie.

Resting on the pointy peaks
Sleep the white glaciers
I can hear the Tlingits speak

This is where my worries flee
In great Alaska
Where my heart will always be.
",Nature
Tapestry,"If I could take a brush and paint the mountains and the moors,
I would splash the hillsides yellow and cover them in gorse.
I'd take the finest needle and the darkest thread of green
And sew a line of bracken along the landscape. In-between

I'd lay a purple carpet of wild heather in the dells
And fringe the edge of all the woods with their pretty lilac bells.
I'd merge the bracken with the heather, mix their colours like the sea,
A green and purple ocean on my own rich tapestry.

Then I'd take a ball of soft, white wool and stitch a mass of daisy chains
Around the lush green meadows and up the sides of winding lanes. 
I would stencil on the marshes, just like pure white china cups,
Some fragile water lilies and by the ponds, sweet buttercups.

I'd mix orange, reds and yellows planting poppies wild and free
Onto nature's coloured canvas, my own rich tapestry.",Nature
"The Tornado
","There is no stopping it.

The sky is falling to the earth,
Like snow in its beauty
But rocks in its destruction.
All living things stand still,
None daring to take a breath,
For fear that the slightest movement
Will push the universe over the edge.
The trees stand still,
And everything listens to the wind,
Whispering a warning to us all.

Suddenly there is a flash.
Light floods the world.

It was the tipping point.

The wind screeches,
And life starts again.
The trees bend and snap,
Unable to bear the weight of it all.
The rain drenches everything,
Showing no mercy for the living things below.

It is chaotic,
Even apocalyptic,
This fear bringing thing.
In a painful cleansing,
All is made new and clean.
The tornado carries a promise
Of things yet unseen.
Be true to Him,
Or face an end to this dream.

The Beauty Of A Tree,"Can there be anything more lovely 
Than the beauty of a tree?
Her leaves shimmering in the wind,
Dancing so gracefully.

The strength of her mighty roots
That grows deep into the earth.
She's weathered every stormy gale
For all that she is worth.

Standing tall, resilient
With her branches lifted high,
She refused to bow, to break or bend
But reaches upward to the sky.

The beauty of the strength within
As she held her head up high.
Her strong resilient spirit
Grew wings and learned to fly.

Oh! It Was The Wind,"I felt a strong air on my hair
Oh! It was the wind.
Side by side, the leaves sway and sway.
Yesterday was a windy day!

I felt a strong breeze on my knees
Oh! It was the wind!
It blew harder and harder as it can, 
Until the heat of the sun was gone!

The kids that play on the ground
Come running and stepping with sound.
The kites that fly so high
Made the children laugh and sigh!

I felt a strong air on my hair,
I felt a strong breeze on my knees 
And then I realized, 
Oh! It was the wind!

A New Dawn,"The central time when dusk meets dawn
and the time when sun touches the lawn,
even in my heart's legacy,
I knew it was sheer ecstasy.
The enchanting time when
Pure dew covers the glen,
The snow on the mountains are blooming white,
except for a few stains by sun's bright light.
I fear it'll never be seen again:
so beautiful, the dawn, seemed a poor bargain,
the gangly reed to the river
say, ""Oh, brother, ye make me quiver.""
The river gurgled along,
wanting to know where it belonged,
the soft green grass busy with ants
showers down the dew in pails,
how I wish this cool and serene
mesmerizing dawn will last forever.
'Twas too good to be true
as it came out of the blue,
the central time when dusk meets dawn
and the time when the sun touches the lawn...

","Taken in by the wondrous air my revere,
The sun is creeping down into the sky,
Slowly descending, yet nowhere near
The aurora is trying to say bye.
Freeing the city of its beaming light,
Only the glowing horizon appears,
Yellow and red lost to the black's might,
Coherent thoughts are becoming unclear.
It's raining, it's pouring, a black sky is falling
All the light is gone, now it's time to play
And the city that never sleeps calling
Me. ""Forget about your chaotic day""
Because right now there is no light
Only from the buildings that shine bright

Watching The Rain,"Rain, glorious, pounding, soaking rain
How I love to hear your song 
Drowning my world in your torrential downpour 
I sit here and contemplate your frenzy dance moves upon my window panes 
Lost I am in your graceful movements 
You dance through the night as the dawn awaits in the horizon 
You sashay your last moves and the sun peeks through the clouds 
Move on, it cries
For it is my time to wash the world with light 
And your last drops bid the world 
Goodbye
",Nature
Poplar,"Alert and splayed branches accept and reinforce 
life's rhythms, existence, and love.

Now in January, I want to write the poplar's pulse, 
but mine quickens as I come close to mediating its presence.

To share its essence, I transcend the desire 
to understand and like the wood.
Pigeons sit content amongst the branches that support me.

Then I watch the squirrels chase, 
their fearless leaps of faith 
one hundred or more feet from the ground 
and feel the excitement of a fool testing the margins.

Now the crow, whose knowing has gone beyond the need to share 
takes me to ambiguity and leaves me 
as it flies beyond to bottomless secrets, 
flashing a hint in its eye, 
on its wing it disappears.

The arms of this tree, vivacious with variation and complexity, 
are in perfect paradox with its innate design to be.

Far As I Can See,"Peering out across the motionless water
No sounds to be heard for miles away 
Nonetheless I remain quiet for now 
Along with noises of the beautiful bay

Like they've known each other for years 
Rekindled spirits together again 
The point where the landscape clears

This part of the world so tender

Somewhere left untouched by us
Like a precious guitar in it's case

When the setting sun mixes golden glitters in the river,
When breaking the dawn the first ray erases the ebony,
My eyes sparkle a li'll brighter,
My heart skips a beat inadvertently.
Beauty comes in and griefs fade. 
This treasury of endless treasure, 
Behold it just a moment ,
The heart'll fill with solace and serenity.",Nature
Footprints In The Sand,"Footprints in the sand
Stay for a minute
Before the waves lift them
Away
Into the unforgiving sea
Leaving you there 
Wishing
That they would stay for a 
Slight moment
Longer
Before they are gone 
Forever",Nature
Nature And Feelings,"The dawn has landed
With a beautiful sunrise,
Amidst tones of green leaves,
Moving swiftly from one place to another.
It takes you along,
Giving you a photographic sensation.
Capturing the beauty of life, 
You walk in between 
The left or the right.
Everywhere are trees and leaves. 
The scattered brownish leaves cover the ground.
Try a low angle shot.
Hard times, good days, 
Smiles and silence.
Walking in peace,
Even the trees murmur,
Leaves make noises.
With the passage of time,
Things change, 
And the dusk falls
With a beautiful sunset 
And unspoken words everywhere.",Nature
"Sing To Me, Autumn","Sing to me, Autumn, with the rustle of your leaves. 
Breathe on me your spicy scents that flow within your breeze.

Dance with me, Autumn, your waltz that bends the boughs of trees. 
Now tell me all the secrets you've whispered to the seas.

Sleep with me, Autumn, beneath your starlit skies.
Let your yellow harvest moon shimmer in our eyes.

Kiss me, Autumn, with your enchanting spellbound ways 
That changes all you touch into crimson golden days.

Love me, Autumn, and behold this love so true
That I'll be waiting faithfully each year to be with you.
",Nature
Autumn's Begun,"Swirling,
Whirling,

With perfect grace.
Guided by the wind to land in an unknown place.

Breezing by,
Flying high.

Gently it rests in a child's dying garden.

A little flitter to the left. A slight flutter to the right. 
The wind will not rest tonight.

Prowling as it comes,
Howling as it carries.

Leaves of every shade twirl and spiral across the cold gray air, 
For the leaves don't care

One leaf crusades through the sky,
                                  
Slowly    
Descending
                                
Without a thought why

Side to side, 
Down and down.
A single leaf on the ground is enough to make anyone frown.

When you're showered with fire, gold, and copper,
When the trees wave at you
And cold, crispy air tickles your nose and makes you feel wonderfully numb,
Then that's when you know autumn's begun.
",Nature
Autumn's Majesty,"Sun with his artistic touch, 
streaks skies of blue with rosy blush,
trimming Oak and Maple too, 
crimson reds with yellow hue.

Birch and Hemlock, purple and gold, 
apples, pumpkins bright and bold,
burns by day and cools by night, 
cloaking trees in fiery might.

Wispy winds and tumbling leaves, 
cypress scents within the breeze, 
starry eves and harvest moon, 
sets the stage for crickets' tune.

As spiders spin their tapestry 
and crickets sing in symphony, 
their final song of destiny, 
it's clear for all the world to see, 
Autumn's vibrant majesty!
",Nature
Autumn Leaves,"Golden, crisp leaves falling softly from almost bare trees,
Lifting and falling in a hushed gentle breeze.
Slowly dropping to the soft cushioned ground,
Whispering and rustling a soothing sound.

Coppers, golds, and rusted tones,
Mother Nature's way of letting go.
They fall and gather one by one,
Autumn is here, summer has gone.

Crunching as I walk through their warm, fiery glow,
Nature's carpet rich and pure that again shall grow.
To protect and shield its majestic tree,
Standing tall and strong for the world to see.

They rise and fall in the cool, crisp air.
It's a time of change in this world we share,
Nature's importance reflecting our own lives,
Letting go of our fears and again, too, we shall thrive.




",Nature
Winter s embrace,"Shimmering lakes of silvery ice
welcomes skaters' scarring slice.
Hills adorned in lacy white
watch children sleigh into the night.
In the brilliant pristine light,
snow birds in tall trees take flight.
Evergreens draped in capes of snow,
their heavy branches hanging low,
blanket earth as north winds blow.
Winter's dance is quite a show,
an ice-kissed, dazzling, magical place,
transformed by winter's cold embrace!
",Nature
"Winter Warmth
","Piles of snow beneath my boots
chilly winds blowing everywhere
snow keeps mounting on the posts
on the windows and on the roads
shovels outside, 
soups inside
hot and rich, 
chicken and corn
coming back from all the work
this is what I look for
the warm chestnuts,
the cracking fire
this is my winter warmth
",Nature
The Hunt For The Northern Lights,"Snowy white fox of the Arctic,
was it your brush-like tail
that sprayed snow, like crystal sparks,
adorning the dark sky with a shimmering veil?
Are you the Northern Lights?

Flourishing forest fungi,
was it your luminescent glow
that ignited fires across the frozen North,
covering the woodland floor, so very long ago?
Are you the Northern Lights?

Plentiful waters of Lapland
was it the light falling into your seas,
that reflected back off the fishes shiny, wet scales 
into the streams of the sky? If so please,
Are you the Northern lights?

Or was it the solar winds that, colliding with earth's gasses,
started to glow, creating streamers in their masses?
A magnificent array of colours. Reds, greens, violets, blues,
A mystical curtain of  bright celestial hues.
Constantly in motion.
A beautiful blaze of auroral displays
Around Heaven's swirling ocean.

AURORA BOREALIS !
Trailing bands of luminous  plasma,
Spellbinding, magical sights.
A plethora of colourful waves from the  sun.
Was He the creator of the wonderful
Northern Lights?
",Nature
I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud,"I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed and gazed but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.",Nature
Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening,"Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.
",Nature
Peace,"THE steadfast coursing of the stars, 
The waves that ripple to the shore, 
The vigorous trees which year by year 
Spread upwards more and more; 

The jewel forming in the mine, 
The snow that falls so soft and light, 
The rising and the setting sun, 
The growing glooms of night; 

All natural things both live and move 
In natural peace that is their own; 
Only in our disordered life 
Almost is she unknown. 

She is not rest, nor sleep, nor death; 
Order and motion ever stand 
To carry out her firm behests 
As guards at her right hand. 

And something of her living force 
Fashions the lips when Christians say 
To Him Whose strength sustains the world, 
""Give us Thy Peace, we pray!""
",Nature
Sea Fever,"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, 
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by, 
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking, 
And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking. 

I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide 
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; 
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, 
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying. 

I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life, 
To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover, 
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.
",Nature
"Music
","Sweet melody amidst the moving spheres
Breaks forth, a solemn and entrancing sound,
A harmony whereof the earth's green hills
Give but the faintest echo; yet is there
A music everywhere, and concert sweet!
All birds which sing amidst the forest deep
Till the flowers listen with unfolded bells;
All winds that murmur over summer grass,
Or curl the waves upon the pebbly shore;
Chiefly all earnest human voices rais'd
In charity and for the cause of truth,
Mingle together in one sacred chord,
And float, a grateful incense, up to God.",Nature
"The Way Through The Woods
","THEY shut the road through the woods
  Seventy years ago.
Weather and rain have undone it again,
  And now you would never know
There was once a path through the woods        
  Before they planted the trees:
It is underneath the coppice and heath,
  And the thin anemones.
  Only the keeper sees
That, where the ring-dove broods        
  And the badgers roll at ease,
There was once a road through the woods.

Yet, if you enter the woods
  Of a summer evening late,
When the night-air cools on the trout-ring d pools        
  Where the otter whistles his mate
(They fear not men in the woods
  Because they see so few),
You will hear the beat of a horse s feet
  And the swish of a skirt in the dew,
  Steadily cantering through
The misty solitudes,
  As though they perfectly knew
The old lost road through the woods ...
But there is no road through the woods.
",Nature
"The Seed-Shop
","HERE in a quiet and dusty room they lie,
Faded as crumbled stone and shifting sand,
Forlorn as ashes, shrivelled, scentless, dry -
Meadows and gardens running through my hand.

Dead that shall quicken at the voice of spring,
Sleepers to wake beneath June s tempest kiss;
Though birds pass over, unremembering,
And no bee find here roses that were his.

In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams;
A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust
That shall drink deeply at a century s streams;
These lilies shall make summer on my dust.

Here in their safe and simple house of death,
Sealed in their shells, a million roses leap;
Here I can stir a garden with my breath,
And in my hand a forest lies asleep.

Who whisper their sonnets and surrender their thrones

Beneath the interior 
You are my humble abode... 
Your company is soothing 
Calming and reassuring 
Inside, the wind chimes ring 
You saunter and my hearts sings

The enchanting glow in your subtle eyes 
Hidden in all abstract paintings 
It's you; what all artists see 
You are poetry",Love
MARRIED LOVE,"You and I 
Have so much love, 
That it 
Burns like a fire, 
In which we bake a lump of clay 
Molded into a figure of you 
And a figure of me. 
Then we take both of them, 
And break them into pieces, 
And mix the pieces with water, 
And mold again a figure of you, 
And a figure of me. 
I am in your clay. 
You are in my clay. 
In life we share a single quilt. 
In death we will share one bed.",Love
Love You,"I love you with a permanence 
That endures the passing years. 
I love you with a joyfulness 
That subdues all doubts and fears. 
I love you with an honesty 
That was born within my heart. 
I love you with the calm belief 
That we will never part. 
I love you with a confidence 
No earthly force can sever. 
I love you with the certainty 
That I'll cherish you forever. 
I love you with the humbleness 
Of one who has been blessed. 
I love you with the reverence 
Of all that word suggests. 
I love you with a fervor 
That time cannot reverse. 
I love you with the truest love 
That poets put to verse.",Love
Soul Like The Vastest Sea,"Your soul is like the vastest sea 
And mine a darting fish: 
I lose myself within your love; 
I live within your heart. 

I breathe your love: it is my air, 
My element, my world. 
I know no other ambiance; 
I have no other dream. 

I know there is outside your love 
A world of rocks and sand; 
And I could live there, too, but oh! 
How poor and thin each breath! 

How rich my world, how beautiful, 
Alive within your love, 
Each moment filled with dancing light 
Refracted through your eyes!",Love
cherished friend,"I love you like I love a day 
when everything goes right 
I love you like I love to lay 
and watch the stars at night 
I love you like I love the rain

until it hurts my face 
I love you like I love to drive 
with no real destination

If There's,"If there's one face I want to see, 
so beautiful, so true, 
one smile that makes a difference, 
to everything I do. 

If there's one touch I long to feel, 
one voice I long to hear, 
whenever I am happy, 
or just needing someone near. 

If there's one joy, one love, 
from which I never want to part, 
it's you, my very special love, 
my world, my life, my heart.",Love
three little words,"Just three little words 
don't seem like enough 
for someone whose smile 
still brightens my day, 
whose touch can make me forget 
the rest of the world. 

They don't seem like enough 
for someone who's always been there 
to celebrate with me 
when everything goes my way 
and to hold my hand 
when my whole world 
seems to fall apart. 

But even though ""I Love You"" 
can't express the depth 
of my feelings for you. 
I hope you know what's in my heart. 
Because loving you 
means more to me 
than anything in the world 
and it always will. ",Love
Dance Me To The End Of Love,"Dance with me in love 
Dance with me in life 
When did enduring love begin? 
The day we became man and wife 

There is patience and understanding 
We try to be unselfish and kind 
Though not a fairy-tale romance 
No greater love will we find 

Sharing dreams, passions, and desires 
Building each other up when we fall 
We've learned to say I'm sorry 
And I love you through it all 

Our two hearts beat as one 
Cherishing what we have from above 
Dance with me forever 
Dance me to the end of love",Love
Red Rose,"Our love is that of a red rose 
Whose splendor rises as the sun shows its face, 
Whose petals expand further and richer 
Whispering secrets of happiness and affection. 

And even though with the fall of dusk 
All contentment is swept away, 
And the rose's petals unite as one 
Reflecting any light that may endeavor to shine through, 
The sun will always rise 
And the rose's petals will eternally broaden 
Until they fully blossom into a stunning creation. 

Our love is that of a red rose 
Possessing a few imperfections 
That may cause evanescent wounds, 
But the internal radiance 
That will everlastingly bestow healing and comfort.",Love
The Golden Path,"Take my hand this way we'll go, 
Said the man above, 
I'll take you to a place of joy, 
Where you will find true love, 

If you let go, go on your own, 
But mistakes you will make, 
For many other ways there are, 
Which you are sure to take, 

When you feel that you are lost, 
All you have to do is pray, 
And I'll be there once again, 
To help you on your way, 

I did pray and just as said,

My Memory Library,"Imagine if I was given one moment,
just a single slice of my past.
I could hold it close forever,
and that moment would always last.

I'd put the moment in a safe,
within my heart's abode.
I could open it when I wanted,
and only I would know the code.

I could choose a time of laughing,
a time of happiness and fun.
I could choose a time that tried me
through everything I've done.

I sat and thought about what moment
would always make me smile.
One that would always push me
to walk that extra mile.

If I'm feeling sad and low,
if I'm struggling with what to do,
I can go and open my little safe
and watch my moment through.

There are moments I can think of
that would lift my spirits every time.
The moments when you picked me up,
when the road was hard to climb.

For me to only pick one moment
to cherish, save and keep
is proving really difficult,
as I've gathered up a heap!

I've dug deep inside my heart,
found the safe and looked inside
There was room for lots of moments;
in fact, hundreds if I tried.

I'm building my own little library,
embedded in my heart,
for all the moments spent with you
before you had to part.

I can open it up whenever I like,
pick a moment and watch it through,
My little library acts as a promise
I'll never ever forget you.",Death

This thing that just won't go away, 
was more then you could take. 
But I'll hold on tight past the very end... 
No matter how much it hurt, 
I sat and watched you get worse. 
I held your hand all through the night, 
never to let go. 
I wake up, and you were no longer here, 
I'm haunted by these memories of you and me, 
as a tear falls down my face I remember... 
You will be here holding my hand all through the night like I did yours,

you will always be in my heart.",Death

out of sight,
but in your heart,
I still burn bright,
think not of sadness,
that I'm not near,
think of gladness,
and joyous cheer,
I have not left,
I am not gone,
I'm here to stay
my little one,
so when you light a candle
and you see it glow

in your heart you'll know
that I would never leave you

my voice is always there,

I have you in my prayer.",Death
In Memory Of My Dad,"If I could write a story,

Birthday Wishes To My Son In Heaven,"If I could have one wish in life,
That wish would have to be
That God would take away my pain
And send you back to me.

Your birthday's here today, my son,
And I just wanted you to know
How much I deeply love you
And that I miss you so.

On days like this we should celebrate,
But for me that now proves hard,
For unlike other mothers, I cannot send
A simple birthday card.

No kisses can I give you
Or birthday gifts to buy,
Only flowers I now can give you,
Which I place down where you lie.

Two other things I send you
Are my thoughts and all my love,
So hold them close and keep them safe
In Heaven up above.

And please wait for me, my darling
Until my days are through,
And then I'll come and spend all time
In Heaven just with you.",Death

A distance apart,

Your strength as a wonderful mother to our mothers and fathers, 
And which we hope to gain in raising your great grandsons and great granddaughters.

My darling grandma, we will always respect all you went through in your hardships and distinguished ways,
Your ability to hold yourself with such dignity and pride in all your days, 
Your beauty shines in us all who were lucky to be part of your devoted family,
We will carry you in our eyes, minds, and hearts in which we have a remedy,

My Darling Grandma, that is to hold you close by all you have taught us to do,
And to remember the beautiful women we owe our lives to,
For giving us life to blessing us with her strong inner spirit of courage,
Her unconditional love and her sensual laughter,
For being such a person in who will always and have always
held deep in our hearts now and here after.

precious place,
May you look down on us with pride on what you brought

Empty Chair,"The chair where you sat lies vacant and still.
The air so silent, through my body runs a chill,

The sound of your laughter echoes in my ears.
The teddy that you loved brings me close to tears.

Photos of you smiling are scattered on the wall.
The sense that you are here, as I walk through the hall.

An empty bed remains made just as it was that night.
Bedroom left alone, even though you're out of sight.

Your DVDs and music left untouched upon the shelf,
Some of which you didn't get to watch yourself.

The cup from which you drank tea alone behind the door,
Left abandoned like a friend not needed anymore.

I looked into the night sky on that fateful night.
I saw a star begin to flicker, like a fading light.

They say a star fades when a life comes to an end,
But for you God made an exception; that rule he did bend.

He reignited the flickering star so we can look above,
To see that star shining bright, showering us with love.

Stars may fade, but the light lives on somewhere.

Happy Birthday In Heaven,"The very first month
Of each passing year
Brings up your birthday

There are years that I smile
Seeing memories of you,
But sometimes it's hard
The whole day through.

I don't buy you gifts 
Or ice cream and cake.
I don't send invites;
There are no guests to thank.

Just as you liked it
When you were with us.
Not much on attention
Or making a fuss.

You'd give others presents
Instead of you.
God understood that
And knew what to do.

He put you together
With a kind heart.
He made you perfect
Right from the start.

You became the present
'Cause he knew how'd you'd be.
Even on YOUR birthday
You'd give the gifts to me.

Yet, it still seems ironic
That on the day of your birth
I got the best gift
With the most worth.

So on January second
Of every year,
I'm down on my knees
And fighting the tears.

I thank God for my gift
Of choosing you as my Dad.

I could have had.",Death

A rose that survived the worst kind of weather and yet the most delicate ever,

I wish that you could come back here

It's only wishful Dreams",Death
My Dad,"My dad was a so very special father to me.

I truly do miss being with my wonderful dad. 
He truly did and still does mean the whole world to me always.
I do miss him being there for me when I need him. 
I still do need my favorite daddy, but he is not with me now and I hope that my daddy is in the best place. 
I do think about my dad on his birthday and all holidays, and I truly can't stop thinking about him because I still love him so very much, and I never will stop loving my dad, not ever.

Remember,"Yesterday life was so precious, so new

To take my ring and my name
Yesterday we took our stroll down the aisle
Yesterday we married
We did it in style
Yesterday we had a daughter
We had a child, can this be true?
Yesterday we had a son
And now there are two.
Yesterday our daughter took our son by the hand
Helping him to walk, helping him to stand
Yesterday all of our parents
Were here and alive
Helping us along, helping us strive
Yesterday our grandparents
They were here too
Loving and laughing
Seeing us through
Yesterdays are such a very special time

I hope you cherish these days
The way I surely have
And I hope you won't let them fade away
No matter how sad

For this we're truly blessed.

Hold strong to our family heritage.
Keep living your life through God.
Keep carrying on the traditions, 
The big ones and the small.

Remember all the good times,
The happiness and the love.
Think of me when you reminisce
As I'll be smiling from above.

My mind's at ease, my soul has peace.
My body's now at rest,

And said God needs the best.

The serenity of going home is a miracle
We all shall seek,

Until we're together again.""",Death

Photographic Memories,"I went through all our old photographs
memories made over thirteen years

Pictures worth a million words
that bring my soul to tears.

I study each one carefully
replaying the memories in my mind

looking for clues of what the future would hold
and the heartache it would leave behind

Smiling children, visiting new places
a canoe trip, a wedding, the park

How could we have known that summer day at the Lake
how quickly our bright lives would turn dark

Birthday smiles and Christmas mornings
Putt Putt golf and a day at the beach

So carefree and not knowing how soon
happiness would be out of our reach

Our passage through life captured on paper
If not for the photos would soon disappear

Fade out of our minds like the love in our hearts
bittersweetly remembered through the years.",Death
I Remember,"Sitting under the old oak tree,
That my grandfather had planted early one spring,
I remember.
A blanket, hand sewn by my grandmother
Neatly spread out, covering the soft green grass beneath,
I remember.
Inhaling the sweet scent of Honeysuckle
Wrapped around an old worn out, rusty fence,
I remember.
Watching the dog and cat playing a game of chase,
Around the farm house
I remember.
Hearing my grandparents call out my name
As it was time for supper,
I remember.

The times that made you laugh.",Death
Almost A Year,"The familiar sting of tears in my eyes

I didn't know the depth of my love

The pain I feel is still as intense
As the very day I had to let you go.

So many thoughts and memories creep
Through my aching mind.

His Decision,"Twins always are a joy,
One little girl and one bouncing boy.

Our parents were so cheerful and gay,
For they were going to meet us both one day.

However, God himself had another plan,
Mapped out before our lives began.

Tell me, what has happened to my other half?
Has he loved? Does he laugh?

How did God choose?
One to keep and one to lose.

all my problems disappearing.

To My Parents,"A day does not go by without thinking of you.
I think of the past and I feel happy and sad.
You both worked hard to take care of us.
My three brothers and I had fun growing up.

I grew up, fell in love and got married.
I was busy with my everyday routine.
Taking care of the house, my husband and son.
The years started to go by so fast.

Before I knew it you were both very old.
I wished I had spent more time with you.
You gave all your time, love and care to us.
But I was too busy to even visit you two.

Now that both of you are dead and buried,
I visit your grave and think of the past.
What I would not give to see you again.
I wish I could go back to the past.

I would spend every day with you two.
I would give you my time and my care.

Daddy's Little Girl,"Waiting patiently to enter the bathroom. 
The doorknob at my eye level...finally unlocks. 
Daddy lets me in...knowing...I don't need to be in there. 
I just want to be in there, with HIM. 
He wipes the misty mirror to see. 
His Daddy smell is all in the steam, 
from his soap on a rope that we got him for Christmas. 
I watch in silent anticipation. 
He shaves, then rinses the last of the fluffy white cream from his face. 
He picks up the bottle from the shelf (the one with the ship on it)
that came with the soap on a rope that we got him for Christmas. 
He splashes the aftershave with slaps and taps all over his face. 
He leans down for me to inspect and I place an approving kiss on it.
Old Spice, nothing smells like it. 
Now, I'm grown and alone, in the store, shopping for Christmas. 
I get a whiff, from an old man standing by. 
I want to cry and I want to buy some soap on a rope, 
with the bottle with the ship on it. 
I want my Daddy back alive. 
I want to, again to be that size. 
The little girl, eye level to the doorknob. 
I take a moment. 
Just one more sniff.

Daddy's smell and Daddy's Little Girl!",Death
A Mother's Touch,"Lay down my little angel
I will rock you to sleep
Close your eyes my little angel,
And don't make a peep.
She holds you close or so you think;
Until you awake and her touch is a dream.

What happened to the warmth, her hands used to bring.
What happened to the mellow, her sweet voice used to sing.
What happened to the smell, her perfume left behind?
What happened to the kiss, she left on my forehead.
What happened to the prayer, she said before bed.

Was it just a dream or long, long ago?
Maybe a year or three.
I guess I will never know.

Will I ever feel her touch?
Will I ever see her smile?
Will she ever kiss my forehead?
Will she ever pray with me just before bed?

Am I her little angel or was it just a dream?
Am I her little angel or so it seemed?",Death
Where Did You Go?,"Are you at the park?
Are you home, maybe you're in heaven or

Sometimes,"Sometimes I catch a glimpse,
In softened waves of blue,
My child, my heart ...when I see a smile,
I can't help but think of you.

Sometimes these waves fill oceans.
And feelings string on every shore,
A collections of each memory
And every way I wish for more.

Sometimes I watch for answers
Because each day I call to you.
I ask for faith and courage
And strength...to help me through.

Sometimes I ask for bravery
Like dolphins in the deep,
Because time moves oh so slowly,
And sometimes the road is steep.

Sometimes I want to scream.
This was not what I had planned.

A mom can't understand.

Sometimes I hear your laughter
And remember you at play,

Not sometimes, but every day.",Death
My Mask,"Every morning I wake up and put on a mask.

I know her time is near and soon you'll take her home
to stroll across the streets of gold where other angels roam.
It's hard to watch her suffer and slowly fade away.
Help me, God, to understand; give me strength, I pray.
She means so much to all of us; forgive me for my fears.
Life will never be the same without her presence here.
My mother is my angel; she taught me how to love
and told me about you, Lord, and heaven up above.
When she crosses over and steps into the light,
tell her that I love her and when the time is right,
meet me at the pearly gates where everything's brand new.
We'll walk across God's meadow lands where skies are always blue.
Somewhere beyond the sunset every now and then,
I pray she watches over me until we meet again.",Death
A Final Goodbye,"Do not weep for me, for I will soon be gone.
My body may die, but my soul will live on. 
Perhaps up to heaven, maybe eternity, 
or be reborn as another, when I am set free.

Do not weep for me, for I will soon be gone.
I was a survivor since my first breath was drawn. 
I loved and was loved by animals and man, 
siblings, friends, and strangers since my life began.

I was blessed with a father who taught me well, 
to live this life on earth as a heaven, not hell. 
A mother who taught me to stand on my feet, 
a faith that anchored me, all strangers to greet.

If you fear dying, you'll not live a full life, 
as pain and dread will cut through like a knife. 
Live each day with joy while you're here on this earth; 
make each day count, with compassion and mirth.

Do not weep for me, for I will soon be gone,
my body may die, but my soul will live on. 
I leave all of you with my love, and I pray
that our souls will touch once again someday.",Death
My Best Friends Departure,"I jumped, you caught me.
I laughed, you joked.
I was down, you picked me up.
I crumbled, you glued me back together.
I loved you, you loved me back.

You jumped, I couldn't catch you.
You forgot to laugh, I couldn't remind you.
You were down, I couldn't hold you.
You crumbled, I had no glue.
You loved me, I still love you.

Without no warning or sign, 
You ventured to a world divine.
I refused to say goodbye, 
Yet tonight I cry.
My tears are for you my friend,
But our legacy will not end.
For I shall see you soon, 
But first I have living to do.
I promise I won't forget,
Your face is embedded in my heart.",Death
Troubled Heart,"The moment you took your life
I felt mine ended too.
If I could only turn back time
there's so much I would undo.

I didn't see the warning signs.
You held them deep inside.
Struggles you were going through
you did so well to hide.

I'm left with guilt and sorrow,
and confusion as to why
you didn't tell me of your pain 
and felt you had to die.

Every soul is precious
in the eyes of God above.
He will heal your troubled heart
with His never ending love.

I'll put my faith in Him,
as I pray my heart will mend,
and keep you in my memory
'till I'm with you once again.",Death
Everywhere,"There was no time to say goodbye.
But this I ask - please do not cry.
Remember me as you think best.
Remember the happy times, but forget the rest.

Look for me and I'll be there,
And you will find me everywhere:
In the gentle touch of the breeze 
That cools the skin or swirls the leaves.

In the scent and color of flowers
That gave me such happy hours.
On sunny days, under sunny skies of blue,
Just think of me, I'll be with you.

In winter when there's cloud or mist,
The rain will give to you my kiss.
As wood smoke lingers in the air,
Look for me and I'll be there.

Where seagulls cry above the sea 
And surf rolls in so endlessly.
Among towering trees that soar above,
In all these things that I once loved.

Look for me and I'll be there.
You'll feel my presence EVERYWHERE!",Death
Time Is Meant To Heal,"Although unheard I thank you
For always being there
Even when you were bedridden
You always seemed to care

You meant so much to all of us
you were special and that's no lie
you brightened up the darkest day
and even the greyest sky

Many tears I have seen and cried
They have all poured out like rain
I know that you are happy now
Cause your no longer in pain.

Four years on I remember you
And what you used to say
You made each of us smile
And live to the fullest each day

They say in time it gets easier
I believe this isn't true
Because even after all this time
I still don't have a clue

I was not ready to say goodbye
Your disease just over took
So on this day we remember you
I take a second look

Our friendship is forever
Until death, did we part
Although your away physically
You're always in my heart",Death
The Last Letter,"A tear ran down her cheek
As she read the words he wrote
His dad sat at the table
With a lump in his throat
The letter was stained
With blood mixed with sand
It was a letter
From their son in a far off land
The letter said, Mom the pain I cannot stand
From the shrapnel that ripped through this young man
I feel the pain so badly
It makes me scream and cry
I know I will not see you
I know that I will die
So I just wanted to say
Before God calls me home
Don't worry about me anymore
No, I am not alone
I know that there will be days
That you both sit and cry
I know there will be days
That you wonder why
The reason is Mom
This is what I signed up to do
So that our country can stay free and true
Well, I will go now
Things are starting to fade
No, I am not alone, Mom, nor am I afraid
But before God calls me home there is something
I must say
I thought of you all each and every day
The medic, he is trying to keep me alive and ease my pain
But I must go now
It is time, God, he says so
I love you all and miss you
This is the last letter
The last one I have wrote.",Death
Remember Me,"Remember me when you hear the wind blow.
I am with God, I need you to know.
He called my name, and I went to see
If the voice I heard was speaking to me.
He took my hand, we walked along
The road to heaven, where I belong.
The angels sang so sweet and clear. 
They sang of love and that Jesus is near.
I felt his touch, I saw his face,
I knew in an instant I was in his grace.
He spoke to me, I heard him say,
You are home now child, you have found your way.
So remember me when you hear the wind blow.
I am home now with God, I need you to know.",Death
The Strength Of One Woman,"She played a different role in all our
lives, a mother, a sister, and a
grandmother, no matter what the love
we have for her is one, ask anyone
they'll tell you the same, she brought
us joy when we had pain , the strength
and love of one women held all of us
together even more now then ever, she
isn't physically here but we still
feel her near in every step we take
and every move we make, what she's
giving to us no one can ever replace.",Death
My Little One,"Doctor said,
I live only three months.
My little darling,
I helped you walk,
Holding your hand.
I found you berries,
In the nearby bushes.
I plucked you cherries,
Whenever you asked.
You were my friend and companion,
In a country abroad.
I wish you all,
That's good in life.
So my little one,
I say goodbye.",Death
Her Home In Heaven,"When God reached down 
And collected her soul
She reached up knowing 
She had to go

Slipping away peacefully
Her body remained
One final look back
She smiled

Reaching home again
A place she'd forgot
Past memories came flooding
With splendor and awe

God gave back sights
We cannot imagine
She finally found
Her home in heaven

We remember her daily
She does the same
We love her always
It will never change

When it's my time to go
There is one thing I know
That she will be smiling
All the way home",Death
Best Friends,"I know you are in a better place
But I miss looking at your face
You were so young to die
Every night I sit and cry
Wondering why does it have to be this way
It hurts so much because there's nothing I can do or say
That can make you come back to me
There is one thing that's plain to see
That one day we will be together again
And now until then you will always remain my best friend",Death
I Will See You Again,"I pray every night I could see you one last time
I look in the clouds as if for a sign
I got to sleep crying, I wish you were here
But there in my dreams you once will appear
That beautiful smile I see on your face
Assures my heart your in a better place
I knew you were special but not just to me
How so many people loved you was clearly to see
The day you were taken my heart was so broken
I knew there were words I should have not left unspoken
I miss you so much but I know you understand
I cant wait for the day I get to hold your hand
As we walk down the road that is paved with gold
We will hear all the stories we were once told
And there we will see Him. so beautiful and strong
And we will know this is where we finally belong
So soon I will be there and I know you will wait
As you take my arm through the pearly gates
But till then I will keep my head high and know it will be OK
Until we can be together again one day",Death
I Had To Cry Tonight,"Winter is here, the air is cold, the snow is deep.

His favorite time of year, he loved the outdoors and the 
challenges of the hunt, the fish, the race.

We planned together, worked together to prepare, and then raced
together as only a son and father can.

We shared our victories and defeats as only two best friends can.

The pictures of Christmas past are only images on a glossy
piece of paper. 

They are no longer memories to relive and share together.

There are no more races to be won or lost.

There are no more stories of the hunt or the fish.

There are only memories of what was and the realization
of what there will not be.

I had to cry tonight",Death
Do Not Cry For Me,"Do not cry for me, my love.
My heart is still with you.

Keep your eyes on God above. 
This pain He'll see you through.

For I am with our Father now,
In His home up above.

I am whole and at peace
And surrounded by His love.

You, too, He'll call home one day
To His mansion in the sky.

And together we will be forever
To praise Him, side by side.",Death
I Am,"I am the sound of the birds,
The whispering in the trees.
The gentle silence after a storm,
And the warm summer breeze.

I am the stars in the sky at night,
I'm those thoughts in your head that say something's right.
I hold your hand when you're feeling low,
Although I get the feeling you just don't know.

I did not die
I am still here.
I'm that gentle voice 
Within your ear.",Death
Safe,"I thought you were gone
Until deep in my sleep
God brought you back
And made my heart leap.

I thought you were gone
As I cried through the day
But God then reminded 
He had more to say:

I gave my own Son
To die on the cross
To pay for all debts
Of sinners once lost.

That guilt that you feel
Is only a trick
Of Satan the devil
Who beats with a stick.

No need to fear
He has no real power
Your son is with me
Safe in my tower!",Death
The Silent Tear,"Near the door
He paused to stand
As he took his class ring
Off her hand
All who were watching
Did not speak as a silent tear
Ran down his cheek
And through his mind
The memories ran
Of the moments they walked
And ran in the sand hand in hand
But now her eyes were so terribly cold
For he would never again
Have her to hold
They watched in silence
As he bent near
And whispered the words
I love you in her ear
He touched her face and started to cry
As he put on his ring and wanted to die
And just then the wind began to blow
As they lowered her casket into
The snow this is what happens to man alive when friends let friends drink and drive.",Death
My Lost Love,"I have only just lost you; the pain is hard to bear.
Do I have to go through life knowing you're not there?
Please, someone explain to me why he had to go.
Are there any reasons I really need to know?
I sit here and remember all the lovely times we shared, 
the talks, the laughter, of everyone you cared.
I am told the pain will ease in time
and I will think of him without a tear,
but that will be impossible as I need to have him here.
He was my very world, my ever guiding star.
Just kiss me softly on the cheek and tell me where you are. ",Death
Reflections,"Remember all those happy days, those times she called our own
In all those well-loved places where you now grieve alone.
And those small endearing gestures, which you thought you knew so well,
Are fading, as time passes, with her words, her kiss, her smell.
But then there is that moment, that time within the day,
When you feel she is beside you in that old familiar way.
But as you turn to see her smile or receive a tender touch,
There's only a dark shadow of the one you loved so much.
And tears begin to fall in that hole of deep despair,
And memories overwhelm you - more than your heart can bear.
As you remember her gentle grace and her love so soft but strong,
Your heart will simply miss a beat as you miss her life, her song.
You want to rewind the clock and say how much you care;
You want to silence the talk that she's not there to share.
But you smile and chat amiably to family and friends
And hope they do not notice your world is at an end.
But she knows that you will carry on because she told you true
That if she had to choose again, she would still choose you.",Death
Do Not Cry,"When I leave this world, please do not cry,
For I have gone up with the spirits in the sky.
Do not place flowers by my side,
For I never got them when I was alive.

Do not dress in fancy clothes;
Dress as you would if I were at home.
Play the songs I have requested,
For this is what I have always wanted.

Do not say how great I was;
Keep those memories between us.
Instead, celebrate the times we have had;
Remember the good, forget the bad.

This is my only final request:
That you do not cry when I am laid to rest.
Remember that my spirit will be with you.
I am still going to be there to see you through.

One last time, do not cry.
Celebrate my memories and life.
Keep my memories in your heart,
For we will never be far apart.",Death
Driven,"Our lifestyles are merely a reflection,
a mirror to our soul
Filled with many mountains 
that shadow some of life's holes

There are many paths to chose from,
yet direction hard to find.

troubled to make up our mind

As we set out on life's journey,
lets not lose focus on our goals
Because the most important part of our journey,
is to never lose sight of the road.",Death
Forever,"A star in the sky reminds me of how bright you were
A flower in the garden reminds me how beautiful you were
A trolley in the trolley bay reminds me of the way we rolled
An elephant reminds me that you cannot forget anything
The iced coffee we used to drink any time of day
The sunshine in the morning makes me smile because I think of you
But you see, all of those things can be taken away
The stars can be covered by clouds
A flower in a beautiful garden can die
A trolley may never roll the same way
An elephant may forget
Someone could drink all the iced coffee in the world
And the sun can be covered by a stormy day
But I have to keep you inside so no one else sees the pain
I miss you so
I miss you here
I wish that you never left
But I loved you then
And I miss you now
But I'll always love you
But most of all I will love you forever",Death

Birthday At The Grave,"I know I haven't visited you
Since the day you were buried
And I just want to say I'm sorry.
But I just still can't believe you're gone, 
And it's getting more real each day.
The crash seems like yesterday.
Although I know it's been quiet some time.
It's almost your birthday.
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.
I already got you a gift but
it's just something small.
I'm going to visit you and unwrap it by your side.
Then scrap up some dirt, and place it in the earth.
Next to it I'll place a picture,
Of us and the team at the pool.
And when you see them,
I hope you know that I still miss you.
And not a single day goes by that I don't wish you were here.",Death
Love Forever Lost,"Like A ghost I flitter through the night,
keeping to the shadows and abhorring the light.

The night camouflages and no one can see 
the shadow of the person that once was me. 
The days lays me bare with no where to hide, 
this raw pain that I feel inside,

You are no longer of this world, 
you inhabit a place of no return, 
no matter the tears or how much I yearn.

All I have left is your memories,
cherish it I will do, 
but I would give everything I have for one more day with you.

Taken From Me,"I'm sitting here in my room, looking at your picture,
wondering why you couldn't be a part of my future.
Uncontrollable tears stream down my face,
while my heartbeat starts to race.
Asking God why he took you from my life,
it was more painful than stabbing me in the heart with a knife.
I still needed you here,
you were the one to make everything so clear.
You are a part of me and I am a part of you.
When you died, a part of me died too.
I never knew how hard it was to lose someone you love
until the day you went to heaven above.
Even though I can't see,
I know you're up there watching over me.
I miss you more and more every day

In my heart you shall forever remain.",Death

""I know you will fall,"" He says.
""But what if I can't get up?
What if I can't go on?
What if my heart breaks into a thousand pieces?""

Mistaken,"There's a girl crying alone in her room,
Wishing she could disappear from this cursed earth.
Dragging a razor blade across her scarred wrist,
She fails to see how much she is worth.

There's a boy that dreams each night,
Hoping to muster the courage to talk to his crush.
He's too afraid of all the judging and name calling to approach him,
But those people lack to remember he's human just as much.

There's a man driving home from work,
Praying his wife hasn't discovered his lies.
Covering up that one night he made a mistake,
He has forgotten we all live under the same sky.

There's a woman sitting in a bar,
Thinking of all the times she's been there before.
She's wondering if she'll ever be truly loved by someone,
But what she doesn't realize is she's worth so much more.

There's a God watching over all of them,
Watching them with unconditional love and pride.
Waiting with open arms to welcome them home,

Lost In Emotion,"Sometimes I feel lost in a maze of emotions,
where every direction feels like a dead-end street.
I feel so alone in my search for an answer
that I start to blame God for not meeting my needs.

But God never promised that life would be easy,
for trials will come in different forms.
But He did promise that He would never forsake us
and that we can still have peace in the midst of the storm.

God's love runs deeper than the deepest ocean,
but He is not altered by the moods that we bring.
For every problem, He has a solution.
He is consistently working behind the scenes.

I cry every night because I'm human, 
and tears are a language God understands. 
I laugh every day 
without one knowing what's really going on in my head.
I smile every morning because I have life. 
I go through every week hoping that things will get better. 
I count the months of disappointments, 
because I know the years of victory will be sweet.
God never gives us more than we can bear,
and I'm going to continue walking, 
no matter how hot the sun is, 
no matter how dusty the day gets, 
how cold the night is,

I will always be grateful.
Where there is life, there is hope.

God's Flight,"On the ground sits a bird
That's too afraid to fly.
Beautiful wings could make it soar,
But the pain of past failure is its lonesome cry.

God has said unto this bird,
""Trust and have faith in me,
for I will carry you in your flight.
The miracle of life is waiting for you to see.""

The bird said to God, ""But I can't fly.
I am weak. I will fall and feel pain.
It's happened before when I tried to fly.
I'm afraid of being hurt again.""

His voice soft and reassuring, God said to the bird,
""I created you, and I will protect you.
Your lonesome cry I have heard.
Have faith in me. That's all you need to do.

So, stand up, bird, and spread your wings.
The wings I lovingly created to let you fly.
If you fall I'll pick you up,
And lift you back into the sky.""

With trembling legs and unsure wings,
The bird finally looked to the sky.
It took a deep breath and took the chance.
The bird began to fly.

""Thank you, God, for believing in me.
Thank you for giving me wings.
Thank you for your protecting hands.
Your glory I will now sing.""

God smiled unto the bird
In its majestic flight.
""Little bird, I'll always be with you,
And will protect you with all my might.

You may stumble. You may fall.
That doesn't mean that I don't care.
I will watch over you in case you need help,
And then I'll be right there.""

A Spritual Journey,"Across from the mountains,
A little house sits in the trees.
I'm lost in tranquility
As my soul tries to breathe.

White clouds moving slowly,
The breeze a calm still.
I'm caught in the moment
As my heart starts to heal.

A piece of me
In the startling blue sky.
As I spread my wings,
My soul starts to fly.

I fly to unknown places,
Where pain and hurt once dwelled.
As the memories flow past me,
My eyes start to swell.

Tear drops drip slowly
Down my cheeks.
The wind wipes them dry
And gives me some peace.

Soaring so free,
Over water and land,
My Spirit Guide gently
Takes me by my hand.

He shows me what was
And what's meant to be
And why my life
Is so important it seems.

A long soar,
Like the eagle high,
I bow my head,
And I start to cry.

Back on the land,
Across from the trees,
I began to realize
What healing means.

It means not to forget,
Let the past flow
Of all the horrors
One soul had to go.

To take the strengths
And apply them to life

I understand what you mean by the Golden Rule--
To create a good life, there is no better tool.

Still, what if you've been taught to look down on others?
Do we want to believe that we are all sisters and brothers?
It's hard not to resent the neighbor next door
Who does so little work, yet has so much more.

There are so many tragedies that happen worldwide.
It brings much unhappiness - that can't be denied.
I sit here complaining when I know it is true
That all of those troubles were not caused by you.

Yes, it just seems to me, if I remember it right,
You did give instructions that could shed lots of light
On the way life could be if Your rules were obeyed.
What a wonderful world it could be if all prayed.

Shortening your long life span
And leaving you destitute and lonely

Lighten Up Today,"When you're going through life's valleys,
And you think there's no way out,
You're not the first to feel this way.
There's hope, without a doubt.

It was easier many years ago,
Thought life would stay that way,
But now you feel like crap,
And it seems it's here to stay.

Your friends have tried to help,
But you tell them it's no use,
You think one has it in for you,
It seems you can't get loose.

Set the problem aside today,
Have fun and take a break.
You have no idea until you try it.
What a difference it can make.

So your trouble didn't vanish,
What time you were away,
But it sometimes makes it easier
And can help you through the day.

If you feel like giving up,
How will you ever know,
If you had diverted your attention,
Learned what God wants you to know?

He wants you to be blessed, He does.
He loves you till it hurts.
He's cared about you many years,
Since you were a little squirt.

If the devil tries to scare you,
You know he's telling tales.
Jesus defeated him completely,
The day he got those nails.

Whatever you are going through,
Keep a song playing in your heart,
And give thanks to God above
You don't push a shopping cart.

The Box,"He ascended those stairs that day, why he did, he could not say.
But reached for that old dusty knob of his attic door insight.
A turn to the knob so gently,
Cautiously he made his entry, entry into the attic that night.

Among cobwebs, dust and in much wonder, a flash of lightning, a crack of thunder,
He lit a small candle to see a bag within his sight.
Inside a dark brown leather sack
Did he find a box so black, as black as it is at midnight.

His soul jumped, and it was frightening, while he gazed in awe during the lightning.
For in his hands was a black box containing his soul that night.
It was black as the midnight sea,
At his feet he found a key, a key to the box of fright.

In a cold sweat, and with a shudder, he turned the box during the thunder.
He pushed in the key and tried to turn, but the lock was too tight.
But as determined as he would,
He turned as hard as he could, he could with all his might.

He knows he is the key that unlocks his soul that resides in the black box.
Amid the lightning he saw his soul was full of sin that night.
The box full of sins he did,
It was filled up to the lid, the lid of the box that night.

So he took paper and found a pen, and recorded the sins he did often.
Tears in his eyes and sorrow in heart he began to write.
I'm sorry for what I have done,
I never meant to hurt anyone, anyone I have hurt any night.

So among the lightning and what wrote, he opened the box and slipped in the note.
For remission of his sins is what he clearly had insight.
And then he laid his head to rest,
For he knew forgiveness was best, best on this thunderous night.

And in the morning they found a dead man, with a note and a pen by his hand.
And on the note was written a poem that previous night.
""My heart is the key which unlocks
The deep dark secrets of my box, a box no longer black, but white.""",Spritual

History,"You were there in  41 when the bombs came raining down
And there in 1945 when victory came to town.
With ticker tape and bands and speeches, loud and raucous cheers,
We all gave thanks to You that day, some through stinging tears.

You were there in 1950 in a far-off frozen land.
At Inchon, at Pusan, wherever we made a stand.
And  53, when peace came, the young men came back home,
You were there among them; they never fought alone.

In 1963, on a bloodstained Dallas street,
Flags everywhere at half-mast, a nation stunned in grief.
A tiny boy s salute that brought us all to tears,
A solemn march to an eternal flame, yet You are still right here.

In  68, in Memphis, on a hotel balcony,
You were in the heart of one who died to set his people free,
And Your voice was in the echo of a thundering broadcast.
Though one shall pay the price...all are  free at last. 

Through Vietnam, through Watergate, foundations of our land
Were shaken badly to the core, but You alone still stand.
Our innocence was lost it seems; why did You go away?
You never really left us; it was we who went astray.

In Munich, 1973, when evil raised its head,
Black-hooded assassins, eleven athletes dead.
Where is justice? Where is God? Why did they have to die?
Yet, Your voice, calm and quiet ""Be still you ll get by. 

September of 2001, need I even say.
The burning pain inside us upon that blackest day.
Satan laughing with delight at all the evil done,
But we, who were divided rose again as one.

Why is it that we only think of You in time of need?
Are we so deaf and blind? Why can we not see?
And you, Osama, you great fool, if you really want changes done
Why can t you follow Gandhi, and King .and Jesus .THEY all WON.

You were aboard Titanic, Lord, when she sailed out on the blue,
You were aboard Challenger, and on board Columbia too,
In a plane over Lockerbie, Scotland .in a London subway train.
Though evil swells from the depths of hell...in the end, You still reign.

I heard a verse long ago about footprints in the sand.
When the years are good, two sets of prints, we walk, Lord, hand in hand.
But darkness comes; we look behind, one set of prints we see.
These footprints are our history .the prints belong to Thee.",Spritual
He Is There,"God comes to us in quiet and simple ways.
He is there when the breeze rustles the palm fronds on a quiet, lazy, sunny afternoon.
When the raindrops softly patter on the thirsty tin roofs of the poor, he is there.

Look for him behind the laughing eyes of a child,
or smell him in blossoming jasmine flowers
on a clear and starry moonlit night.
Hold his hand when you take your love by the hand,
and feel the warmth of his tears
as you console a grieving friend in your arms. 

He is there in a baby's first cry
and in the dying man's last sigh.
When the waves break on the golden sands
and the seagulls fly into the white clouds,
when the church bells ring on an Easter Sunday
inviting you to receive the sacred brad, he is there.

Taste him when you bite into the yellow ripeness of a mango
or when you quench your thirst with sweet water of a coconut.
God comes to us only in quiet and simple ways.
Never his presence in violence will you find;
never look for him in words of anger or cowardly actions.

His love and his peace surround us, above and beyond.
And only in those simple, everyday things
when we look with our eyes filled with his love
can we find him.",Spritual
God's Poetry,"When you look at the trees you feel inner peace.
And when you see the seas you feel blessed.
God's poetry is all around us.
To know his beautiful pictures on his great canvas is beauty to the beholder.
No fortune teller can surpass his knowledge and no painter can outdo his pictures of wonderful love.
We should all love God, for He is truth, life, and the way!
Each day we should praise him and give true thanks for everything He has done for us.
Indeed, God is a true poet and in the holy Bible, you will find the truth and word of real meaning and love,
And above all, you will feel tranquility when one day you meet God.
He is the most special spirit to admire and adore. 
And He is precious to many people.
And those that attend church meetings are doing what is right in their hearts.
Yes, God is a true poet and loving toward all his children.",Spritual
A Strong Comfort,"He gives me strength

on days when I'm weary

The Lord is there 
to dry my sore eyes.
Sometimes I wander off the path, 
losing sight.

That is when he gently 
guides me into his light.
He is a loving father 
to the fatherless,

a comfort to the broken hearted,
to those who are abused 
and have forgotten 
the Lord is their healer.

When storms toss you about, 
causing confusion, 
just find a place to pray.

My Contemplating Creation Of The Universe,"The Lord created me in the beginning of his works, 
before all else, 
when he set the heavens in their place, I was there, 
before he made the earth, I was his darling child
and played the creation game, in eternal joy with him. 
I was his craftsman and his companion and delight. 
Wisdom and word is my name 
and I was with him before all creation. 
He is the ancient of days and I am his eternal son. 

We together created mighty superstrings 
and weaved them together with colossal strands of energetic light 
colored in beautiful magnificent opalescence 
into the very fabric of reality 
and a new unimaginably beautiful universe was born in glory and delight.

We sang together the song of creation 
and the new universe began to vibrate with countless frequencies of light, 
glory translucent and everlasting with the vibrations of the song of existence. 
The singer sang the song, 
the painter the painting, 
the creator the creation. 

The universe then began to weave, dance, and vibrate flux and vortex into one colossal maelstrom, 
spiral in perfect order from the mind of the eternal one. 
The Universe danced and sang with joy. 
The dancer danced and sang along with his new creation.


Oh! How we rejoiced together that wonderful day. 
The mighty suns began to sing together the beautiful song of creation 
across the vastness of the marvelous new mighty universe. 
All sang together in wonderful harmony. 

In pristine beauty was the planet earth created.

But God hesitated and decided to first create immortal companions Angels of light that would serve him, without question. 

He then looked at that most unique and beautiful pristine of water blue worlds, 
planet earth in a beautiful universe, 
we call it planet earth and the sun around which it revolves is called Sol.

God then created all the creatures on the earth 
and in the universe gave humanity a colossal complex brain 
so that they could look after all the creatures on blessed mother earth. 
He gave humanity one thing unique from all the other creatures, 
namely, a free will without any restrictions or reservations or conditions.",Spritual
My Confession,"The rain drips down from the windows

I hate to look through them by myself.
Maybe my tears,
they will wash my sins away.
Windex is what I need

Widows rimmed red and puffy
spotted with dirty deeds
this green monster is growing inside me
this thing, is getting bigger.
It will appear over night
after planting three magical beans,
sky rocketing to the sky blaming whoever is near.
Instead lead me to the sky
oh big, green, bean stalk.

of this thing growing in me
Because
anger, revenge, and guilt
will just heighten the pain.

At times we want to lay it all down to you, and at your feet we fall. You show us that there is a way and help us to give it our all. You give us the faith to be stronger, even though we may not know. The things that are not of you, you help us to let go. You are my strength, my deliverer, the rock that makes me unbroken. You lead me to be righteous with things I feel are all unspoken. We pray for understanding, but sometimes we may stumble. We look up to you for answers that our world may never crumble. We know at that time you will be there to carry us through it all. You are there to pick us up, even as we may fall. Father, our ever living God, we ask you for your pardon, For one day we will be with you, living in your heavenly garden. Until then, Lord, thank you for all the many blessed filled days.

In deep dark tunnels of despair,

When I stumble, He lifts me up
And leads me through valleys far and wide.
Streams flow and meander with life-giving water,
A place where I can sit and stay.

He knows my every thought,
Even the secrets of my heavy heart.

Fueling my fears

Of the demon inside me
And the hell that is near

Stripped of my dignity

Leaving me naked 
And hollow inside

First came guilt
Then paranoia set in

Sonnet 34: Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds oertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross.
   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

Those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
And reade the sorrowes of my dying spright,
Written with teares in harts close bleeding book.

When ye behold that Angels blessed looke,
My soules long lacked foode, my heavens blis.

And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds oertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross.
   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

Does the touch of my hand give you warmth in your heart?

Will you think of me and smile?
Will you reflect on the things I have done and laugh?
Will you remember the sound of my voice finding joy?
Always remember the love and the warmth in my heart, for now it is yours!

For I have lived and brought you my smile!
For I have lived and given you my laughter!
For I have lived and given you my joy!
Remember that your heart now holds my smile, my laughter and my joy!

The love and warmth of my heart is with you because through my soul I found joy in life.
God has given me all of these things and now I leave these things with you, 
I do not leave you behind, I leave behind these things that God gave to me, I give to you!
For the life that I have lived and in yours I will always be, for you will always carry a part of me!

Sailing To A Far-Away Land,"Overwhelming lust for times long gone
The wet dog shakes
Pungent orders fill the room
What a mess
Help, I'm going down
Tears won't change it
Words, empty words
Anger
Oh, I'm angry
I just can't shake it
Invisible barriers crowd my presence
I just can't shake it off
Help, I'm going down with the boat
As captain, I want to sail to some far away land
I can't shake it off
A rancid taste in my mouth
Milk...I drank milk and the taste lingers
I've had enough
I want peace
I want joy
I want to sail to a far-away land
I'm so tired
I want to sleep
I want to dream

Oh, he is gone

That Girl,"Forever feeling her life is dying
But the doctors keep on lying.
""Your daughter will be fine,
Just give her some time.""

But she wasn't okay
Because your baby girl took her life today.
She couldn't keep running
And she wouldn't stand living.

Her silent plea's for love
Left her heart on black doves.
""I'm in pain""
Her innocence cut, her pride slain.

Her cries fell on deaf ears
So no one realized her fears.
No one saw her fatal change
Until her heart was out of range.

She wrote out letters 
Saying her life would be better.
She laid the pistol on her heart
And blew her body apart.

Her parents cry themselves to sleep
And all her friends weep.
They loved that girl well
And left her alone in Hell.

Maybe her soul can be free
And everyone will see
The lost life of one teen
And the love there could have been.

"The Fight
","My bodies cold
lips are blue
why did I do this because of you?

I feel the earth below me 
like a pillow under my head
no knives, no guns, but pills instead

The bottle lays empty
cap unscrewed
what did I do? what did I do?

My spirit floats my body lays
my lover finds me
and he prays

I reach for him
I'm sucked away
like a deep crest of a wave

he pounds the ground
screaming why oh why?
I asked myself why did I?

My parents arrive, my best friend too
I thought to myself, What did I do!?

I look away the pains to deep 
my life is over because of me

I look back for one last glance
they zip me up in the body bag.
I did this to ease my pain
I lost instead of gained

as I look down my family 
I regret that night
my life stopped ticking
because of a fight.

This Is For The Best,"one sad cold night
a boy sat in his chair
picked up a gun
as he ran his fingers through his hair
he sat and cried as he thought
everything that's happened
has all been my fault
he said if I was gone
this would all be better
and he told her 
""I love you now more than ever""
he said ""trust me
this is for the best
you will see
cause after I'm gone
no more fighting, you'll be free""
he grabbed a bullet
an put it in the gun
said, ""I love you so much
but now I have to run""
he said ""I'm sorry I can't take this no more.
I've let down so many people
I wish I could go back to before""
he hung up the phone 
and pulled the trigger
looked down at his chest
as the pain grew bigger
his eyes filled with tears
they started to pour
as soon as his family ran in
he fell to the floor

Why Dad Did You Choose Suicide?,"Why Dad,
Why did you chose to die?
You left no note and me with why?
You thought you were doing what was best and right.
Why, oh why, did you have to end the fight?
Your pain is something I will never understand.
You must have been so afraid to take this stand.
You left me with a title I am sad to attain.
Suicide Survivor, but who should I blame?
I know your decision was painful to make.
The thoughts in your head
Must have been unbearable to take.
Now that you're gone, I think of you a lot.
You couldn't have known the suffering this has brought.
I pray you are at peace my Angel, and I am in pain.
I count the minutes to Heaven and seeing you again.

Zach's Poem,"I wish that I could talk to you,
and beg you not to go.
I wish I asked what you were going through,
but now I'll never know.

I wish that I had some warning
of what you'd do that night,
and that you'd given me a chance to save you,
to help you make things right.

I wish that you could've soldiered on,
and worked through the pain.
If you had, I promise you,
you would've been happy one day.

I wish that the last time I saw you
I didn't rush away.
I wish that I had hugged you harder,
and told you I loved you that day.

I wish that I could bring you back
to see you one last time,
to hug you close, to hear your voice,
and then the world would be fine.

But all these things can't ever happen,
the nightmares are all about you.
There's not one thing I can change,
because these wishes will never come true.

What Would You Do,"You look at her and call her a whore 
when she is fighting in this secret war. 
you do not know what she has been through, 
but with the most sincere regret I do.
I cried with her every night 
but then one day she gave up the fight. 
the truth of the story is that she was not a whore 
it was without consent that he came through her door. 
there was nothing she could do or say 
he pushed her out of his way 
she tried to scream and shout as loud as she could 
but it didn't do her any good.
Once everything was said and done 
9 months later she had a son. 
She could never get past the pain 
so here in front of me she lays 
there's a hole through her head as she lies in a pool of red. 
There is nothing that you can do or say 
For she has long gone away

I Had To Cry Tonight","Winter is here, the air is cold, the snow is deep.

His favorite time of year, he loved the outdoors and the 
challenges of the hunt, the fish, the race.

We planned together, worked together to prepare, and then raced
together as only a son and father can.

We shared our victories and defeats as only two best friends can.

The pictures of Christmas past are only images on a glossy
piece of paper. 

They are no longer memories to relive and share together.

There are no more races to be won or lost.

There are no more stories of the hunt or the fish.

There are only memories of what was and the realization
of what there will not be.

All On A Silent Night,"On a silent night.
I lay in the dark, not caring, trying not to breathe. 
It's almost time, time to say goodbye.
Never again will I shout in pain.
Never again will I scream in vain.
I'm done with these feelings I can't control.
There is no more time to make amends.
No more time to fix everything.
My time is finally up.
I lay silently.
In the dark, alone.
Never moving, never speaking.
Not making a single sound.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
The people I love are better without me.
This is what I think, for now.
I put the blade to my wrist.
Cutting deeper, and deeper.
The blood flows, and I slowly slip away.
Consciousness fades.
The pain finally ends.
Only to begin again.
I look back as I float away.
Look at the pain, on their faces.
The pain, as they discover my body.
The pain that will be there, forever.
It tears my heart in two.
To watch them, as they cry.
Cry over me.
More pain, even in death.
I thought it was the end.
But I guess there is no escape.
From this much pain.
Never an escape.
I hurt those I love. 
And I realize, that was what was hurting me.
But now its to late.
I ended it, forever.
There is no going back.
Their pain is endless.
I caused it, my fault, forever.
All on that Silent night.

Mirror,"My life is now my delusion,
A world made of fantasies.
Happiness is no longer the illusion,
My life is my new disease.

No longer waiting to see what happens,
No more waiting on fate.
I will decide where it all ends,
I will show you all my hate.

You claim to be full of anger,
You spread nothing but lies.
Your time in my mind is in danger,
For you are whom I truly despise.

The look in your eyes is hard to handle,
It's almost something to be feared.
Is this true or just another scandal?
Where is your face--just mine I see mirrored.

No More Pain,"Crazy thoughts in his head, 
all he wants is to be dead.
Inside he's screaming, feels a lot of pain,
day by day he's going insane.

His drinking increases he wont stop,
all that including smoking pot.
Drugs thinking for him, he can't think,
all he wants is for his mind to be blank.

He plans the day, says goodbye,
we think jail, but that was a lie.
He's screaming we don't hear him,
""This is the only way"", he thinks, 
""I'm not going back to the pin.""
He tries to seek help, they don't listen, they didn't care how he felt.

That night he took a rope put it around his neck and choked.
No more pain, at least not for him,
all because of drinking and drugs I lost my best friend.

No more crazy thoughts in his head,
he got what he wanted...now he's dead.

In this world while it twirls when it whirls
her head in a haze

If she screams no matter what she shouts
Not a soul hears her cry

She's consumed by her morbid thoughts
Everything around, the pain has brought
Her slit wrists 
Her bloody grip
She raised her arm once more

life of endless flow,
unconditional love for our master above

Do You really think this is something I could make it through?
These expectations You've given me, I cannot live up to

Guilt takes control and yells with expression,
""What a coward! What a waste of time! What a weak and useless failure!
How is God going to use you?! You will only ruin your future!""

""That is my precious daughter, whom I deeply love.
She is an empty vessel for My power and glory.
She is a broken girl whom I will give a beautiful story.""

""You're looking at the wrong reflection, that's why you can't understand.""
He hands me a cup, full of red blood.
""This is how I see you, My child, saved by My love.""

I look at my reflection, then back up at Him.
I shake my head. ""How could You love me this much?""

""I supply your every need.
Your help is found in Me.
I empower the fearful,
And I strengthen the weak.""

I'm in a state of confusion,
And I have mixed feelings about nothing.
But all the same,
I have to do something with my life.
To me, there's no hope'
And no hand to hold on to.
I feel like giving up now.
But then, I remember the Good Old Book,
""Come to Me all you who labor....""
""....able to do exceedingly abundantly....""
It's then that I realize that,
All hope is not lost,
Because all I ever needed, is
Divine Intervention....",Spritual
Creation,"Was the world created by God's hand as told in holy writ,
When scientific findings seem to dash the thought of it?
Is it possible that all things formed the way they are by chance?
With the odds against such: infinite...it causes second glance.

None thinks a simple tool exists without creator's hand.
Thus, how can it be justified that all we see...not planned?
So what is truth? Which concept right? Both theories seem quite odd.
The key that makes one theory whole: the purpose of our God.

If he created everything, for what reason was it done?
Was it not to test his children and a throne with him be won?
And if this life then be a test, upon what topic is it based?
Deferring back to holy text, the subject matter: faith.

The test would be quite meaningless if God uttered out his voice, 
And made the world such that Creation was the only choice.
It stands to reason that he must have made the world ""As Is"",
So that Evolution and Creation would both have solid bids.

And so it is, all get their chance to search amongst the clues,
Eternity hangs in the balance...which path will you choose?
A lifetime we are given and it's never too late to start,
But may I offer some advice...trust the feelings of your heart.",Spritual
If God Says Yes,"No matter if you're big or small,
The hero inside you can conquer all.
Transform your mind in a positive way,
And see the improvement day by day.

You may not have the best support,
But cast your weakness unto God.
Each step you take requires courage,
Which leads to goals being reached.

Be proud of the smallest things you achieve.
It's even more reason for you to believe.
Maybe you think it's no big deal,
But through each victory something got healed.

Don't underestimate yourself.
There's power in your Spritual wealth.
You may be doomed by all the rest,
But you can do all, if God says yes!",Spritual
Lamentation,"I always want to be somebody; 
Who has everything - wealth, power and glory.
People will look at me with envy;
Crying and hoping that they are me.

Dreaming. Wanting. Wishing.
My heart desires for luxurious living.
Drink. Eat. Be merry;
Oh! What a good life would that be.

But I realized- stricken, awakened,
How meaninglessly I lived!
How foolish I was- tricked, deceived;
To live in vain- wanting the rubbish things.

Ashamed. Unworthy. Guilty.
How wicked I am before Thee;
To trust on temporal things- transient, worthless,
To forsake, forget and renounce Thy grace.

Vanity! How plain and nonsensical,
To be passionate for things not eternal.
Behold! Confess. Repent.
Be changed. Be changed.",Spritual
"Teach Me, Lord","Teach me, Lord,
What I don't know.
Show me which way
And where to go.
Alone I stumble,
Alone I fall,
But your gentle voice
Leads through it all.
Take my hand,
Light my way,
Be my beacon
Night and day.
I am weak
And sometimes so low,
But you give me strength
And make me whole.
Teach me, Lord and Father.
Your child has become like new.
Empty me of myself
So I can live for you.",Spritual
This Brand New Day,"This brand new day I go in faith,
But I know not what lies in wait,
So dear God, this morning I pray,
Take control and lead the way.

I do not see with these two eyes,
I cannot tell where danger lies.
Please dear Lord, be my guide.
Let me not stray from Your side.

Show me today the journeys to make.
Steer me on the right paths to take.
Grant me grace to discern your will,
For when to strive and when to be still.

Help me to love and trust You more
And radiate Your love to my neighbor.
Then bring me back safe and sound,
And let my praise for You abound.",Spritual
A Gentle Breeze,"As I sit here all alone admiring the view of an early sunrise, 
I tilt my head back and close my eyes.
A soft gentle breeze crosses my face.
I look around and enjoy the quietness of God's peace and the soft gentle pace.
The trees are in full bloom, the leaves ready to fall.
God's beauty of earth, I admire it all.
As the sun comes up and begins a new day,
I sit here quietly and begin to pray.
Dear God, I begin to say, please watch over my life and keep me safe.
Give me hope and show me faith.
Guide my path and let me know you are near.
Allow me to be strong and filled with love, for love conquers all fear.
A gentle breeze crosses my path and gives me a slight chill.
God answers and says: I am with you still.
I've never left you alone or threw you aside, I am in your heart, I will be your guide.
I will show you the way to master life's difficulties and trust your heart,
For I am with you now and forever, I shall never part.
A gentle breeze I feel again, I know my prayers are answered, God has heard my plea.
He has pointed this out for me to see.
Life has many surprises each and every day. We cannot live on regrets and sorrow.
Once again I feel a gentle breeze, which means God is saying:
My child, there is a tomorrow:
The sun will shine once again, the birds will continue to sing.
Memories will last forever, and enjoy life anew today, and all that it may bring.",Spritual
My Fallen Hero,"Life is given as a gift,
So wonderful and new.
We need to live it day to day,
Being careful as we do.
True treasure is not found in pirate ships,
In chests of silver and gold.
Treasure isn't ruby rings,
And jewels from long ago.

My treasure is you, being my hero.

Every morning I wake up and think,
Did I pray for him in my sleep?
I think about you all the time,
Hoping and praying you know I'm at your side.

Whenever you feel like no one is there,
Just close your eyes and I'll be there,
Hoping and praying each and every day,
And leaving the bad news to yesterday.

Now all I do is think about you and cry.
I cherish all the memories that are shared,
And remember how much I love and care.
You are gone now, and it's still hard to part,
For I will always think of you in my heart!",Spritual
A Mother's Love Prayer,"Lord, help me be the Mother
You've chosen me to be, 
One parent with a loving heart,
The mother of my three.

Give me wisdom and courage.
A righteous and faithful leader I'll be,
So I may live through you, Lord,
An example of good I may be.

Teach me patience and understanding,
Grant me compassion and kindness too,
So my daughters may desire a tender heart,
Being kind, forgiving, and true.

Help me show them the way to salvation,
Lord, and the value of their souls,
So they may sustain love, hope, and faith,
That will lead them on their pathway home.

Remind me to hold them tightly
And tenderly let them go
So they might feel my comfort and love
When at times they may feel alone.

And in our body's absence, Lord,
I'm praying they may know
The only need that they would have 
Is what I've instilled in their heart and soul.",Spritual
A Letter To God,"Dear God,

Can you hear me?
Can you please take my hand?
I need your loving arms around me-
I need to know you understand.

I'm feeling angry and helpless,
Even lonely and sad.
Am I wrong? Is Satan winning?
I know he wants me so bad!

Will I ever know freedom?
Will I always be bound? 
How does he enter 
When Your love's all around?

When I can't fight these feelings,
It helps to write them all down.
Then I find myself kneeling
With my face to the ground.

Thank You, God, once again
For lending an ear, 
And that you not only listen,
But you care enough to hear.

Please help me, dear Jesus,
To find the strength deep within,
To fight these inner demons
That try to lead me to sin.

Please help me to smile
When what I wanna do is weep,
And please stay with me tonight.
Now I lay me down to sleep.

Healing Love,"Oh Great God, You alone can ease
The pounding of my troubled heart.
Only with You I am at peace,
For You make all my fears depart.

Comfort me with Your blazing love
And pacify my worried soul.
Your grace of love from up above
Is healing love that makes me whole.

Cast away all my doubts and fears,
And lift my downcast spirit, Lord.
Please let my heart be brought to cheer
By Your comforting love and Word.

My body and mind may be frail,
But your healing love keeps me strong.
Your love will never ever fail,
So to me, nothing will go wrong.",Spritual
These Ol' Shoes,"Lord, it's a mountain you gave me to climb,
and I've had my share of mountains behind.
Each time I've climbed I depended on faith
to guide me along with each step I take. 
But Lord, the path gets so rocky at times;
I feel I can't go on in these ol' shoes of mine.
Rugged, worn, torn and abused,
I sometimes forget the purpose for which they are used.
Please give me strength to continue on. 
Please give me courage for this journey unknown. 
And when my shoes no longer hold to my tired and weary feet,
please help me to remember shoes are not needed on heaven's holy streets.",Spritual
Lost My Way,"Oh Lord, oh Lord, with words sincere,
I ask your help - please will you hear?
This world has torn my integrity apart,
and so to you I pour out my heart.

Whenever I ask, you give with no delay.
Yet it's not long till I throw it away.
This is not a wrong, sin or evil.
For even these words shun with retrieval.
Not even darkness can bear to see.
Oh, what has happened to me?

I used to stand against this world so strong
When it was you I leaned upon.
I was so young with circumstances so bad.
With only your refuge I had.
My mother gone, stability and security too,
Leaving me not knowing what to do.
Yet in this time so dark... with light brighter than the sun
You gave it a spark.

Please help me again to keep us friends,
and not to follow this world's trends.
You've given me a gift so good!
And I've broken it like termite wood.
So I ask with shame in a six foot grave.
Can you help fix my life... in which you gave?",Spritual
A Daughter's Blessing,"Today is the beginning
Of God's perfect plan anew
And from here you'll grow and nurture
All the gifts inside of you

Created for God's glory
You've been blessed from up above
Endowed with grace and beauty
As a symbol of His love

You will walk in paths of honor
And you'll speak at wisdom's gate
You'll be known among the noble
Of all women small and great

You will see through eyes of faith
When the storms of life rage strong
You will stand upon God's promise
And find peace to carry on

You will listen with your heart
And be swift to hear the good
With a kind and gentle spirit
You'll treat others as you should

And as your mother, I'm very proud
Of what you will become
Inside my heart you hold a place
Reserved for only one",Spritual
Bird-Understander,"Of many reasons I love you here is one

the way you write me from the gate at the airport
so I can tell you everything will be alright

so you can tell me there is a bird
trapped in the terminal      all the people
ignoring it       because they do not know
what to do with it       except to leave it alone
until it scares itself to death

it makes you terribly terribly sad

You wish you could take the bird outside
and set it free or       (failing that)
call a bird-understander
to come help the bird

All you can do is notice the bird
and feel for the bird       and write
to tell me how language feels
impossibly useless

but you are wrong

You are a bird-understander
better than I could ever be
who make so many noises
and call them song

These are your own words
your way of noticing
and saying plainly
of not turning away
from hurt

you have offered them
to me       I am only
giving them back

if only I could show you
how very useless
they are not",Love
